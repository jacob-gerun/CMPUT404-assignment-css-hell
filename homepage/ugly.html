                    Through technical and non-technical experiences,

            <h2>What I have to Offer</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Though my internship experience, I have gained
                a strong technical base of skills in Python and Typescript/React.
                My experience in school has also gaven me a wide range
                of technical and non-technical skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                Through my varied internship experience, I have gained a strong set
                of techincal skills and the ability to communicate well enough to
                get these tasks done efficently.
                In combination with my experience in customer facing non-techincal roles,
                I belive I am a strong canadiate that would fit well in any team.
